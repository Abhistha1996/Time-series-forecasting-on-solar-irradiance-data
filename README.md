# Time-series-forecasting-on-solar-irradiance-data

• Background: Solar radiation is an important source for electricity generation. For effective utilization, it is important to precisely know the irradiance amount at different time horizons: minutes, hours, and days. Depending on the horizon, two main classes of methods can be used to forecast the solar radiation: statistical time series forecasting methods for short to midterm horizons and numerical weather prediction methods for medium- to long-term horizons. 

• Objective: To forecast the next day solar irradiance (measured in W/m2) values using ClimaCell API data (6-hours per day) and real weather station data from a solar plant.
